# Object-Detection
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects in images or videos. It is an important part of many applications, such as surveillance, self-driving cars, or robotics.
Object detection algorithms can be divided into two main categories: single-shot detectors and two-stage detectors.

One of the earliest successful attempts to address the object detection problem using deep learning was the R-CNN (Regions with CNN features) model, developed by Ross Girshick and his team at Microsoft Research in 2014. This model used a combination of region proposal algorithms and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and localize objects in images.

Object detection algorithms are broadly classified into two categories based on how many times the same input image is passed through a network.

Single-shot object detection
Single-shot object detection uses a single pass of the input image to make predictions about the presence and location of objects in the image. It processes an entire image in a single pass, making them computationally efficient.

However, single-shot object detection is generally less accurate than other methods, and itâ€™s less effective in detecting small objects. Such algorithms can be used to detect objects in real time in resource-constrained environments.

YOLO is a single-shot detector that uses a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) to process an image. We will dive deeper into the YOLO model in the next section.

Two-shot object detection
Two-shot object detection uses two passes of the input image to make predictions about the presence and location of objects. The first pass is used to generate a set of proposals or potential object locations, and the second pass is used to refine these proposals and make final predictions. This approach is more accurate than single-shot object detection but is also more computationally expensive.

Overall, the choice between single-shot and two-shot object detection depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.

Generally, single-shot object detection is better suited for real-time applications, while two-shot object detection is better for applications where accuracy is more important.
